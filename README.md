# MiSeqTools
This is a collection of scripts for processing fastq files to analyze 16S rRNA data using QIIME or minimum entropy decomposition (MED).

## Getting it up and running
You can get these scripts by typing this into terminal:

	git clone https://github.com/bulksoil/MiSeqTools.git

You will need to acquire pandaseq to form the overlap on the paired end reads.  Assuming you are running Ubuntu just put this into the command line.

	sudo apt-add-repository ppa:neufeldlab/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pandaseq
